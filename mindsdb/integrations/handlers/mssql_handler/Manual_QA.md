## Testing MsSQL Handler with [Diabetes Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/mindsdb-examples/a43f66f0250c460c0c4a0793baa941307b09c9f2/others/diabetes_example/dataset/diabetes-train.csv)

**1. Testing CREATE DATABASE**

```
CREATE DATABASE mssql_test        --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE='mssql',                    --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS={
  "host": "azurehostaddress",                          --- host name or IP address
  "port": 1433,                             --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "database": "DIABETES_DATA",                      --- database name
  "user": "mlantz",                          --- database user
  "password": "changme"                       --- database password
