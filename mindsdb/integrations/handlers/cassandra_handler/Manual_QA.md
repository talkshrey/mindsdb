## Testing Cassandra Handler with [Home Rentals](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mindsdb-example-data/home_rentals.csv)

**1. Testing CREATE DATABASE**

```
CREATE DATABASE home_rentals  --- display name for database. 
WITH ENGINE = 'cassandra',     --- name of the mindsdb handler 
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "dummy",              --- Your database user.
    "password": "1234",          --- Your password.
    "host": "1.2.3.4",              --- host, it can be an ip or an url.

**2. Testing CREATE PREDICTOR**

```
CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb.home_rentals_model
FROM home_rentals 
    (SELECT * FROM rentals)
PREDICT rental_price;
```

**3. Testing SELECT FROM PREDICTOR**

```
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.predictors
WHERE name='home_rentals_model';
```
