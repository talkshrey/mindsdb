## Testing Singlestore Handler with [Predictive Maintenance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgadincer/predictive-maintenance?select=train.csv)

**1. Testing CREATE DATABASE**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE predictiveMaintenance WITH engine='singlestore',
PARAMETERS = {
  'user': 'admin',
  'password': 'MJFn{VOoaKhr._Hl:[._',
  'host': 'svc-123ae0c5-21f7-4541-840d-7ad6e0f2d5e9-dml.aws-virginia-4.svc.singlestore.com',

  'port': '3306'
};
```

**2. Testing CREATE PREDICTOR**

```sql
CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb.machine_failure_model FROM
predictiveMaintenance.train
(
  SELECT * FROM train LIMIT 10000
)
PREDICT machine_failure;
```
