    in `libs/ml_exec_base`.

      - A SQL statement is sent to the MindsDB executor
      - The statement is parsed, and a sequential plan is generated by `mindsdb_sql`
      - If any step in the plan involves an ML framework, a wrapped engine that inherits from this class will be called for the respective action
          - For example, creating a new model would call `create()`
      - Any output produced by the ML engine is then formatted by the wrapper and passed back into the MindsDB executor, which can then morph the data to comply with the original SQL query
