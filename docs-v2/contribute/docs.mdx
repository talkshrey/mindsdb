MindsDB documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs)
and use
[Material theme for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). The
source code is located under
[docs directory](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/docs) in
MindsDB repo.

Documentation can always be improved so we don't have a strict guideliness to
follow. We accept any sort of documentation and tutorials improvments, adding
missing documentation, new tutorials or keep up the documentation up to date.

## Running the docs locally

First install the mkdocs and mkdocs-material theme in your python virtual
environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, navigate to the `/mindsdb-docs` directory and start the server:

```
mkdocs serve
```

The documentation website will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Repository structure

The mindsdb-docs layout is as follows:

```
