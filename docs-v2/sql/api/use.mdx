# USE statement

The `use integration_name` statement provides an option to use the connected
datasources and `SELECT` from the database tables. Even if you are
connecting to MindsDB as MySQL database, you will still be able to preview or
`SELECT` from your database. If you haven't created a datasource after
connecting to your database check out the simple steps explained
[here](/connect/#create-new-datasource).

## Preview the data

To connect to your database `use` the created datasource:

```sql
use integration_name
```

Then, simply `SELECT` from the tables:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
