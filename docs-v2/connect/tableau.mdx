## How to Connect

Follow the steps below to connect your MindsDB to Tableau.

First, create a new workbook in Tableau and open the _Connectors_ tab in the
_Connect to Data_ window.

</p>

Next, choose _MySQL_ and provide the details of your MindsDB connection, such as
the IP, port, and database name. Optionally, you can provide a username and
password. Then, click _Sign In_.

Now you're connected!

## Overview of MindsDB in Tableau

The content of your MindsDB is visible in the right-side pane.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/connect_tableau_3.png" />
</p>

All the predictors are listed under the _Table_ section. You can also switch
between the integrations, such as _mindsdb_ or _files_, in the _Database_
section using the drop-down.

Now, let's run some examples!

## Examples

### Example 1

Previewing one of the tables from the _mysql_ integration:

</p>

### Example 2

There is one technical limitation. Namely, we cannot join tables from different
databases/integrations in Tableau. To overcome this challenge, you can use
either views or custom SQL queries.

- Previewing a view that joins a data table with a predictor table:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/connect_tableau_6.png" />
</p>

- Using a custom SQL query by clicking the _New Custom SQL_ button in the
  right-side pane:

</p>

## What's Next?

Now that you are all set, we recommend you check out our **Tutorials** and
**Community Tutorials** sections, where you'll find various examples of
regression, classification, and time series predictions with MindsDB.

To learn more about MindsDB itself, follow the guide on
[MindsDB database structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on the
remaining pages from the **SQL API** section, as they explain a common SQL
syntax with examples.

Have fun!
