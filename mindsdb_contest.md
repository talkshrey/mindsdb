# Democratize Machine Learning on ... Contest 🎆 🎉

MindsDB is an open-source project on a quest to democratize machine learning and take it closer to your data, and we want you to join in. 

The *Democratize Machine Learning on ... Contest* is a competition for data professionals, developers, machine learning experts, technical managers, students, business analysts, decision-makers, etc.

We invite you to contribute to our project at the open brainstorming session by telling us where you would connect MindsDB to generate predictions. Currently, we support most of the SQL databases out there.

### How to participate? 🏁

1. Create a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues/new?assignees=&labels=integration%2Cenhancement&template=integrations_contest.yaml&title=%5BNew+Integration%5D%3A+).
2. Invite everyone to upvote by adding 👍(thumbs up) emoji to your issue.
3. Share it on the MindsDB Slack community at [the `using_mindsdb` channel](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtMzU5ODc5OTMzMDYzMC1iYzc1MmFkMjY0MDQ0MmM0OTM2ZWY0MzU2NWY2NjBmM2I5MjZlN2JlZDIzN2M4MzQwNzY3MzJhMjJmNjcyYWM1).
4. [Fork MindsDB repository](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/fork) (optional).
5. Commit the basic structure for the new integration (optional):
	 * [ ] Add a new integration directory under `integrations`.
	 * [ ] Add `__about__.py` file containing all variables as this example.
	 * [ ] Add empty `tests` directory.
	 * [ ] Add empty `__init__.py` file.
6. Make a Pull Request to MindsDB Repository from your fork and tag the idea issue.

### Rules 🚥

* MindsDB team will review the ideas and label them as `accepted`. Once an idea is reviewed and accepted, it is moved to the [`Integrations ideas` project](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/projects/9). 
* People will start voting on the proposed ideas and discuss further implementation.
* The top 3 authors, whose ideas will get the highest number of upvotes 👍, are the winners. If multiple ideas have the same number of votes, the first one posted wins. Please feel free to submit as many ideas as you like. However, we will not sum up upvotes from multiple issues from a single author. We'll take just one that has the highest number of votes. 
* Make sure you complete all the steps above to be considered for a prize. After the deadline, we move the issues with the ideas to the `Implementation ideas` phase, where the number of votes they scored is added as a comment. Note that we only count the votes from the accounts created at least a month before the contest started to avoid vote-rigging.

📣 ~~We will announce the winners on our [Community Slack](https://mindsdb.com/joincommunity) during the first couple of days after the submission deadline.~~
