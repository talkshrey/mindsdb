## Description

The `CREATE MODEL` statement creates and trains a machine learning (ML) model.

<Info>
    Please note that the `CREATE MODEL` statement is equivalent to the `CREATE PREDICTOR` statement.
    We are transitioning to the `CREATE MODEL` statement, but the `CREATE PREDICTOR` statement still works.

## Syntax

### Overview

Here is the full syntax:

```sql
CREATE MODEL project_name.predictor_name

[FROM integration_name
    (SELECT [sequential_column,] [partition_column,] column_name, ...
     FROM table_name)]

PREDICT target_column

[ORDER BY sequential_column]
[GROUP BY partition_column]
[WINDOW int]
[HORIZON int]

[USING engine = 'engine_name',
       tag = 'tag_name'];
```

| Expressions                                     | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project_name`                                  | Name of the project where the model is created. By default, the `mindsdb` project is used.                                                      |
| `predictor_name`                                | Name of the model to be created.                                                                                                                |
| `integration_name`                              | Name of the integration created using the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases/) statement or [file upload](/sql/create/file/).            |
| `(SELECT column_name, ... FROM table_name)`     | Selecting data to be used for training and validation.                                                                                          |
| `target_column`                                 | Column to be predicted.                                                                                                                         |
| `ORDER BY sequential_column`                    | Used in time series models. The column by which time series is ordered. It can be a date or anything that defines the sequence of events.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `GROUP BY partition_column`                     | Used in time series models. It is optional. The column by which rows that make a partition are grouped. For example, if you want to forecast the inventory for all items in the store, you can partition the data by `product_id`, so each distinct `product_id` has its own time series.                        |
| `WINDOW int`                                    | Used in time series models. The number of rows to look back at when making a prediction. It comes after the rows are ordered by the column defined in `ORDER BY` and split into groups by the column(s) defined in `GROUP BY`. The `WINDOW 10` syntax could be interpreted as "Always use the previous 10 rows". |
| `HORIZON int`                                   | Used in time series models. It is optional. It defines the number of future predictions (it is 1 by default). However, the `HORIZON` parameter, besides defining the number of predictions, has an impact on the training procedure when using the Lightwood ML backend. For example, different mixers are selected depending on whether the `HORIZON` value is one or greater than one. |
| `engine_name`                                   | You can optionally provide an ML engine, based on which the model is created.                                                                   |
| `tag_name`                                      | You can optionally provide a tag that is visible in the `training_options` column of the `mindsdb.models` table.                                |

### Regression Models

Here is the syntax for regression models:

```sql
CREATE MODEL project_name.predictor_name
FROM integration_name
    (SELECT column_name, ... FROM table_name)
PREDICT target_column
[USING engine = 'engine_name',
       tag = 'tag_name'];
```

<Note>
Please note that the `FROM` clause is mandatory here.
</Note>

The `target_column` that will be predicted is a numerical value. The prediction values are not limited to a defined set of values, but can be any number from the given range of numbers.

### Classification Models

Here is the syntax for classification models:

```sql
CREATE MODEL project_name.predictor_name
FROM integration_name
    (SELECT column_name, ... FROM table_name)
PREDICT target_column
[USING engine = 'engine_name',
       tag = 'tag_name'];
```

<Note>
Please note that the `FROM` clause is mandatory here.
</Note>

The `target_column` that will be predicted is a string value. The prediction values are limited to a defined set of values, such as `Yes` and `No`.

### Time Series Models

Here is the syntax for time series models:

```sql
CREATE MODEL project_name.predictor_name
FROM integration_name
    (SELECT sequential_column, partition_column,
            other_column, target_column
     FROM table_name)
PREDICT target_column

ORDER BY sequential_column
[GROUP BY partition_column]

WINDOW int
[HORIZON int]

[USING engine = 'engine_name',
       tag = 'tag_name'];
```

<Note>
Please note that the `FROM` clause is mandatory here.
</Note>

Due to the nature of time series forecasting, you need to use the [`JOIN`](/sql/api/join) statement and join the data table with the model table to get predictions.

### NLP Models

Here is the syntax for using external models within MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE MODEL project_name.model_name
PREDICT PRED
USING
  engine = 'engine_name',
  task = 'task_name',
  model_name = 'hub_model_name',
  input_column = 'input_column_name',
  labels = ['label1', 'label2'];
```

<Note>
Please note that you don't need to define the `FROM` clause here. Instead, the `input_column` is defined in the `USING` clause.
</Note>

It allows you to bring an external model, for example, from the Hugging Face model hub, and use it within MindsDB.

## Example

### Regression Models

Here is an example for regression models that uses data from a database:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.home_rentals_model
FROM example_db
  (SELECT * FROM demo_data.home_rentals)
PREDICT rental_price
USING engine = 'lightwood',
      tag = 'my home rentals model';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

Visit our [tutorial on regression models](/sql/tutorials/home-rentals/) to see the full example.

### Classification Models

Here is an example for classification models that uses data from a file:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.customer_churn_predictor
FROM files
  (SELECT * FROM churn)
PREDICT Churn
USING engine = 'lightwood',
      tag = 'my customers model';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

Visit our [tutorial on classification models](/sql/tutorials/customer-churn/) to see the full example.

### Time Series Models

Here is an example for time series models that uses data from a file:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.house_sales_predictor
FROM files
  (SELECT * FROM house_sales)
PREDICT MA
ORDER BY saledate
GROUP BY bedrooms
-- the target column to be predicted stores one row per quarter
WINDOW 8      -- using data from the last two years to make forecasts (last 8 rows)
HORIZON 4;    -- making forecasts for the next year (next 4 rows)
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

Visit our [tutorial on time series models](/sql/tutorials/house-sales-forecasting/) to see the full example.

### NLP Models

Here is an example for the Hugging Face model:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.spam_classifier
PREDICT PRED
USING
  engine = 'huggingface',
  task = 'text-classification',
  model_name = 'mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-sms-spam-detection',
  input_column = 'text_spammy',
  labels = ['ham', 'spam'];
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

<Tip>
    **Checking Model Status**
    
    After you run the `CREATE MODEL` statement, you can check the status of the training process by querying the `mindsdb.models` table.

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM mindsdb.models
    WHERE name = 'predictor_name';
    ```

    On execution, we get:

    ```sql
    +---------------+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----+-----------------+----------------+
    |name           |status                             |accuracy                                |predict                |update_status|mindsdb_version|error|select_data_query|training_options|

## Tuning the Lightwood ML Engine Features

### Description

In MindsDB, the underlying AutoML models are based on the [Lightwood](https://lightwood.io/) engine by default. This library generates models automatically based on the data and declarative problem definition. But the default configuration can be overridden using the `USING` statement that provides an option to configure specific parameters of the training process.

In the upcoming version of MindsDB, it will be possible to choose from more ML frameworks. Please note that the Lightwood engine is used by default.

### Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```sql
CREATE MODEL project_name.predictor_name
FROM integration_name
    (SELECT column_name, ... FROM table_name)
PREDICT target_column
USING parameter_key = 'parameter_value';
```

#### `encoders` Key

It grants access to configure how each column is encoded. By default, the AutoML engine tries to get the best match for the data.

```sql
...
USING encoders.column_name.module = 'value';
```

To learn more about `encoders` and their options, visit the [Lightwood documentation page on encoders](https://lightwood.io/encoder.html).

#### `model` Key

It allows you to specify the type of machine learning algorithm to learn from the encoder data.

```sql
...
USING model.args = {"key": value};
```

Here are the model options:

| Model                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### Other Keys Supported by Lightwood in JsonAI

The most common use cases of configuring predictors use `encoders` and `model` keys explained above. To see all the available keys, check out the [Lightwood documentation page on JsonAI](https://lightwood.io/api/types.html#api.types.JsonAI).

### Example

Here we use the `home_rentals` dataset and specify particular `encoders` for some columns and a LightGBM `model`.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.home_rentals_model
FROM example_db
    (SELECT * FROM demo_data.home_rentals)
PREDICT rental_price
USING
    encoders.location.module = 'CategoricalAutoEncoder',
    encoders.rental_price.module = 'NumericEncoder',
    encoders.rental_price.args.positive_domain = 'True',
    model.args = {"submodels": [
                    {"module": "LightGBM",
                     "args": {
                          "stop_after": 12,
                          "fit_on_dev": true
                          }
                    }
                ]};
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```
