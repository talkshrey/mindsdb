MindsDB provides a powerful MySQL API that allows users to connect to it
using the MySQL Command Line Client.

Please note that connecting to MindsDB's MySQL API is the same as connecting to
a MySQL database. Find more information on MySQL CLI
[here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html).

## How to Connect

To connect to MindsDB, run the below command in your MySQL CLI and provide the
connection details, such as host, port, username, and password.

```bash
mysql -h [hostname] --port [TCP/IP port number] -u [user] -p [password]
```

Here are the commands that allow you to connect to either a local MindsDB
installation or a MindsDB Cloud instance.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash Self-Hosted Local Deployment
    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 --port 47335 -u mindsdb
    ```

    ```bash MindsDB Cloud
    mysql -h cloud.mindsdb.com --port 3306 -u [mindsdb_cloud_username] -p [mindsdb_cloud_password]
    ```

</CodeGroup>

On execution, we get:

```bash
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Server version: 5.7.1-MindsDB-1.0 (MindsDB)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MySQL [(none)]>
```

## Example

In this example, we connect to the MindsDB Cloud instance, as below.

```bash
mysql -h cloud.mindsdb.com --port 3306 -u zoran@mindsdb.com -p
```

On execution, we get:

```bash
Enter password:

Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Server version: 5.7.1-MindsDB-1.0 (MindsDB)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MySQL [(none)]>
```

**Community Tutorials** sections, where you'll find various examples of
regression, classification, and time series predictions with MindsDB.

To learn more about MindsDB itself, follow the guide on
[MindsDB database structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on the
remaining pages from the **SQL API** section, as they explain a common SQL
syntax with examples.
