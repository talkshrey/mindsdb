MongoDB Shell is the quickest way to connect and work with MongoDB.

MindsDB provides a powerful MongoDB API that allows users to connect to it using
the [MongoDB Shell](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell). Please note
that connection to MindsDB's MongoDB API is the same as connection to a MongoDB
database.

## How to Connect

To connect to MindsDB, run the below command in your Mongo Shell and provide the
connection details, such as host, port, username, and password.

```bash
mongo --host [hostname] --port [TCP/IP port number] -u [user] -p [password]
```

Here are the commands that allow you to connect to either a local MindsDB
installation or a MindsDB Cloud instance.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash Self-Hosted Local Deployment
    mongo --host 127.0.0.1 --port 47336
    ```

    ```bash MindsDB Cloud
    mongo --host cloud.mindsdb.com -u [mindsdb_cloud_username] -p [mindsdb_cloud_password]
    ```

</CodeGroup>

On execution, we get:

```bash
MongoDB shell version v4.0.28
Enter password:
connecting to: mongodb://cloud.mindsdb.com:27017/?gssapiServiceName=mongodb
Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID("b2afbba1-ddfd-4379-944f-ca2eadsdas") }
MongoDB server version: 4.0.28
>
```

## Example

In this example, we connect to the MindsDB Cloud instance, as below.

```bash
mongo --host cloud.mindsdb.com -u zoran@mindsdb.com -p
```

On execution, we get:

```bash
MongoDB shell version v4.0.28
Enter password:
connecting to: mongodb://cloud.mindsdb.com:27017/?gssapiServiceName=mongodb
Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID("b2afbba1-ddfd-4379-944f-asdasaasd") }
MongoDB server version: 4.0.28
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are all set, we recommend you check out our **Tutorials** and
**Community Tutorials** sections, where you'll find various examples of
regression, classification, and time series predictions with MindsDB.

To learn more about MindsDB itself, follow the guide on
[MindsDB collection structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on
the remaining pages from the **Mongo API** section, as they explain a common MQL
syntax with examples.

Have fun!
