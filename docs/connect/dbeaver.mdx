DBeaver is a database tool that allows you to connect to and work with
various database engines. You can download it [here](https://dbeaver.io/).

## Data Setup

First, create a new database connection in DBeaver by clicking the icon, as
shown below.

</p>

Next, choose the MySQL database engine and click the _Next_ button.

<Warning>
If you have multiple `MySQL` options, choose the `Driver for MySQL8 and later`.

Now it's time to fill in the connection details.

</p>

There are two options, as below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Connecting to MindsDB Cloud account">
    You can connect to your MindsDB Cloud account. To do that, please use the connection details below:

    ```
    Hostname: `cloud.mindsdb.com`
    Port: `3306`
    Username: <your MindsDB Cloud username>
    Password: <your MindsDB Cloud password>
    Database: <leave it empty>
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Connecting to local MindsDB">
    You can connect to your local MindsDB. To do that, please use the connection details below:
    
    ```
    Hostname: `127.0.0.1`
    Port: `47334`
    Username: `mindsdb`
    Password: <leave it empty>
    Database: <leave it empty>
    ```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

Now we are ready to test the connection.

## Testing the Connection

Click on the `Test Connection...` button to check if all the provided data
allows you to connect to MindsDB.

On success, you should see the message, as below.

## Let's Run Some Queries

To finally make sure that our MinsdDB database connection works, let's run some
queries.

```sql
SHOW FULL DATABASES;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+----------------------+---------+--------+
| Database             | TYPE    | ENGINE |
+----------------------+---------+--------+
| information_schema   | system  | [NULL] |
| mindsdb              | project | [NULL] |
| files                | data    | files  |
+----------------------+---------+--------+
```

Here is how it looks in DBeaver:

<Tip>
**Whitelist MindsDB Cloud IP address**

If you need to whitelist the MindsDB Cloud IP address to gain access to your
database, reach out to the MindsDB team, and we'll share the MindsDB Cloud
static IP address with you.

## What's Next?

Now that you are all set, we recommend you to check out our [Tutorials](/sql/tutorials/house-sales-forecasting) section where you'll find various examples of
regression, classification, and time series predictions with MindsDB or [Community Tutorials](/tutorials) list.

To learn more about MindsDB itself, follow the guide on
[MindsDB database structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on the
remaining pages from the **SQL API** section, as they explain a common SQL
syntax with examples.

Have fun!
