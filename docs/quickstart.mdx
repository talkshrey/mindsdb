title: Quickstart
---

Follow the steps below to start making data forecasts with MindsDB using standard SQL.

Check out our [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/) to set up and work with
MindsDB using your own data and models.

## 1. Create a MindsDB Cloud Account or Install MindsDB Locally

Create your [free MindsDB Cloud account](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/register) to
start practicing right away using the MindsDB Cloud Editor.

If you prefer a local MindsDB installation, follow the **Deployment** guides of
MindsDB documentation. You can install MindsDB using
[Docker](setup/self-hosted/docker/) or follow the standard installation using
[pip](setup/self-hosted/pip/source/).

## 2. Connect to MindsDB from a SQL Client

You can use the MindsDB Cloud Editor or open your preferred SQL client, such
as DBeaver or MySQL CLI, and connect to MindsDB.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Using the MindsDB Cloud Editor">
    Log in to your MindsDB Cloud account. The
    [Editor](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/editor) is the first thing you'll see!
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Using a Third-Party SQL Client">
    To connect to MindsDB from a third-party SQL client, use the connection details
    below.

    ```
    User: your_mindsdb_cloud_username
    Password: your_mindsdb_cloud_password
    Host: `cloud.mindsdb.com`
    Port: `3306`
    ```

    <Tip>
      If you do not have a preferred SQL client yet, we recommend using the [MindsDB
      SQL Editor](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/editor) or [DBeaver Community
      Edition](https://dbeaver.io/download/). Follow [this guide](/setup/cloud/) to
      set up your MindsDB SQL Editor. And [here](/connect/dbeaver/), you'll find how
      to connect to MindsDB from DBeaver.

## 3. Connect a Database Using [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases/)

We have a sample database that you can use right away. To connect a database to your MindsDB Cloud account, use the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases/) statement, as below.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE example_data
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
  "user": "demo_user",
  "password": "demo_password",
  "host": "3.220.66.106",
  "port": "5432",
  "database": "demo"
};
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (3.22 sec)
```

## 4. Preview the Available Data Using [`SELECT`](/sql/api/select/)

You can now preview the available data with a standard `SELECT` statement.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM example_data.demo_data.home_rentals
LIMIT 10;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+-----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
| number_of_rooms | number_of_bathrooms | sqft | location | days_on_market | initial_price | neighborhood | rental_price |
+-----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
| 0.0             | 1.0                 | 484  | great    | 10             | 2271          | south_side   | 2271         |
| 1.0             | 1.0                 | 674  | good     | 1              | 2167          | downtown     | 2167         |
| 1.0             | 1.0                 | 554  | poor     | 19             | 1883          | westbrae     | 1883         |
| 0.0             | 1.0                 | 529  | great    | 3              | 2431          | south_side   | 2431         |
| 3.0             | 2.0                 | 1219 | great    | 3              | 5510          | south_side   | 5510         |
| 1.0             | 1.0                 | 398  | great    | 11             | 2272          | south_side   | 2272         |
| 3.0             | 2.0                 | 1190 | poor     | 58             | 4463          | westbrae     | 4124         |
| 1.0             | 1.0                 | 730  | good     | 0              | 2224          | downtown     | 2224         |
| 0.0             | 1.0                 | 298  | great    | 9              | 2104          | south_side   | 2104         |
| 2.0             | 1.0                 | 878  | great    | 8              | 3861          | south_side   | 3861         |
+-----------------+---------------------+------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
```

You could also browse the databases of MindsDB using the command below.

```sql
SHOW databases;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+---------------------+
| Database            |
+---------------------+
| information_schema  |
| mindsdb             |
| files               |
| example_data        |
+---------------------+
```

To learn more about MindsDB tables structure, check out
[this guide](/sql/table-structure/).

## 5. Create a Model Using [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/predictor/)

Now you are ready to create your first model. Use the
[`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/predictor/) statement, as below.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.home_rentals_model
FROM example_data
  (SELECT * FROM demo_data.home_rentals)
PREDICT rental_price;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (9.79 sec)
```

## 6. Check the Status of a Model

It may take a couple of minutes until the model is trained. You can monitor
the status of your model by executing the following command:

```sql
SELECT status
FROM mindsdb.models
WHERE name = 'home_rentals_model';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------------+
| status     |
+------------+
| generating |
+------------+
```

After a short time, we get:

```sql
+----------+
| status   |
+----------+
| training |
+----------+
```

And finally, we get:

```sql
+----------+
| status   |
+----------+
| complete |
+----------+
```

Alternatively, you can use the `SHOW MODELS` command as below.

```sql
SHOW MODELS
[FROM project_name]
[LIKE 'model_name']
[WHERE column_name = value];
```

Here is an example:

```sql
SHOW MODELS
FROM mindsdb
LIKE 'home_rentals_model'
WHERE status = 'complete';
```

<Warning>
  The status of the model must be `complete` before you can start making predictions.
</Warning>

## 7. Make Predictions Using [`SELECT`](/sql/api/select/)

The [`SELECT`](/sql/api/select/) statement allows you to make predictions based
on features, where features are the input variables, or input columns, that are
used to make forecasts.

Let's predict what would be the rental price of a 1000 square feet house with
two bathrooms.

```sql
SELECT rental_price
FROM mindsdb.home_rentals_model
WHERE number_of_bathrooms = 2
AND sqft = 1000;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------------+
| rental_price |
+--------------+
| 1130         |
+--------------+
```

<Check>
**Congratulations!** If you got this far, you have successfully trained a predictive model using SQL
and got the future data!
